# MoreThanFood, Combatting Eating Disorders at NYUAD

This is the backend for MoreThanFood, built using Django REST API and deployed on Heroku.

## How it works

Users posts and comments are stored and accessed through 2 urls: /posts and /comments.
Users are anonymous by default and admins must have a passcode to delete and create verified posts and comments.
